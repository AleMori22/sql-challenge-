# sql-challenge

You'll find the sql scripts: Table Creation - SQL Challenge.sql and Query - SQL Challenge.sql; in the folder SQL_Script, this two scripts will generate the tables, based on the .csv files located in the Resources folder, and compute the queries required for the challenge.
In the EDR directory you'll find two files named EDR-SQL-Challenge.png that show the structure of the database, by showing the connections between the data held in the tables.
All the code you'll find was made by me  with the help of the classes material.
